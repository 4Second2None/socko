The biggest functionality for the next release of Socko is a REST endpoint handler that also supports swagger.

For this, we would like to use Scala reflection available in 2.10.

Scala 2.10 is currently at milestone 5 and will not be released until Aug/Sept. Because of the release date 
and the fact that we have to learn how to use the new APIs, the next release of Socko may not be until Oct.

If you have any burning issues, let us know and we'll try to put out an interim release.

Thanks
