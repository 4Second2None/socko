Hi,

I know we've not pushed out a new release in a while.

We are still waiting on Scala 2.10 and Akka 2.10 to be released before we get started on 
Socko [v0.3](https://github.com/mashupbots/socko/issues?milestone=3&page=1&state=open).

In the meantime, we've done the Martin Odersky Scala course at coursera.org to improve our
Scala skills.

I've also been working on [Plebify](https://github.com/mashupbots/plebify) to try out the 
new features of Akka 2.1. Planning to use the "to be written" REST features of Socko v0.3 in 
Plebify as well.

Here's an interesting project using Socko: [akka.js](https://github.com/teamon/akka.js).
Angular.js -> Websocket -> Socko -> Akka and back! Good stuff :-)

If you have any burning issues, let us know and we'll try to put out an interim release.

Thanks
Vibul
