This [release](https://github.com/mashupbots/socko/issues?milestone=9&state=closed) includes:
 - Upgrade to AKKA (2.2.3) and Netty (4.0.14.Final) thanks to [thirstycrow](https://github.com/thirstycrow)
 - Support for independently pushing messages to all or specific web socket connections
 - Notification when a web socket connection is closed
 - Support for idle connection timeout
 - Support for HTTP headers with the same header name

Download [socko-webserver_2.10-0.4.0.jar](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/org/mashupbots/socko/socko-webserver_2.10/0.4.0/socko-webserver_2.10-0.4.0.jar).

For use with Simple Build Tool or to build from source, see our [download](/download.html) page.

There are **BREAKING CHANGES** in this release.

 - `WebSocketBroadcaster` is no longer supported. Use `webServer.webSocketConnections.writeText("My Message")` instead.

 - `onComplete` callback function now takes a web socket id as a parameter rather than the `WebSocketHandshake` event.
   You can still write to the connection using `webServer.webSocketConnections.writeText("My Message", webSocketId)` where
   `webSocketId` is the function's input parameter.

Also, **SPDY** is not working as yet. I'm tyring to debug the upgrade to Netty 4 and SPDY3.
